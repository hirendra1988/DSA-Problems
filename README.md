# 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Swift

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for traversing or searching through a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## Features
- Implements BFS for an undirected graph.
- Supports adding edges between nodes.
- Displays the graph structure.
- Outputs the traversal order of nodes.

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V)
V is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph.
E is the number of edges.

# 2. Depth-First Search (DFS) in Swift
## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for traversing or searching through a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking to explore other branches, making it useful for problems where exhaustive path exploration is required before moving to the next path.

## Features
- Implements DFS for an undirected graph.
- Supports adding edges between nodes.
- Displays the graph structure.
- Outputs the traversal order of nodes.

- Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- Space Complexity: O(V)
- V is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph. 
- E is the number of edges.
