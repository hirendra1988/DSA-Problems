# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Swift

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for traversing or searching through a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## Features
- Implements BFS for an undirected graph.
- Supports adding edges between nodes.
- Displays the graph structure.
- Outputs the traversal order of nodes.
